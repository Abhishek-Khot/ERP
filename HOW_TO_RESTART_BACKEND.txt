                    HOW TO RESTART BACKEND SERVER
================================================================================

STEP 1: STOP THE OLD SERVER
----------------------------
Find your terminal/command prompt where the backend is running.
You'll see something like:

    Server running on port 5050
    Connected to MongoDB

Press: Ctrl + C

You should see the cursor return and the server stop.


STEP 2: START THE NEW SERVER
----------------------------
In the same terminal, type:

    npm start

Press Enter.

Wait for:
    Server running on port 5050
    Connected to MongoDB


STEP 3: TEST AGAIN
-------------------
Go back to your browser and try generating ID cards again.


================================================================================
                         ALTERNATIVE METHOD
================================================================================

If you can't find the terminal window:

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: d:\ERP\ERP\
3. Double-click: restart-backend.bat
4. A new window will open with the backend server


================================================================================
                         WHAT YOU'LL SEE
================================================================================

BEFORE RESTART (Current - OLD CODE):
- Generate: 400 Bad Request - "No students found"
- Download: 404 Not Found
- No debug logs in backend console

AFTER RESTART (NEW CODE):
- Generate: Success or detailed error with debug info
- Download: Success or detailed error
- Backend console shows:
  üéØ ID Card Generation Request
  üîç Debug - All matching students by ID
  üìö Students found in database
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Students found but schoolId mismatch (if applicable)


================================================================================
                    WHY RESTART IS REQUIRED
================================================================================

Node.js loads all files into memory when it starts.
Changes to files are NOT automatically picked up.
You MUST restart the server to load new code.

Think of it like:
- Editing a Word document (making code changes)
- But still viewing the old PDF (old server running)
- You need to regenerate the PDF (restart server) to see changes
