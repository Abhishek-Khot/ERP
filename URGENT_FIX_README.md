# 🚨 URGENT: ID Card 404 Error Fix

## The Problem
ID card generation is returning **404 Not Found** errors.

## The Solution (2 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Restart Backend Server

**In your backend terminal:**
```powershell
# Press Ctrl + C to stop the server
# Then run:
npm start
```

**OR use Task Manager:**
- Find "Node.js" process (PID: 9040)
- End Task
- Then run `npm start` in backend folder

### 2️⃣ Test Again

1. Refresh your browser
2. Go to Academic Details → ID Cards
3. Select students → Click "Generate & Preview"

## Why This Fixes It

Node.js doesn't automatically reload route files. The backend server was running with old configurations before the ID card routes were properly set up. Restarting loads the new routes.

## Verification

After restart, you should see in **browser console**:
```
🎯 Generating ID cards for students: {...}
✅ ID cards generated successfully
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
```

## Still Not Working?
