# User Management System Improvements

## Overview
The user management system has been completely overhauled to provide a standardized, comprehensive, and user-friendly experience for managing students, teachers, and administrators.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Standardized Data Structure
- **Created unified interfaces** (`frontend/src/types/user.ts`)
- **Consistent field mapping** across all user types
- **Proper data transformation** between frontend and backend
- **Type safety** with TypeScript interfaces

### 2. Comprehensive User Forms
- **Single reusable form component** (`frontend/src/components/forms/UserForm.tsx`)
- **Role-specific sections** that appear based on selected user type
- **Complete field coverage** including:
  - Basic information (name, email, phone)
  - Contact details (emergency contacts, multiple phones)
  - Address information (permanent and current)
  - Identity documents (Aadhar, PAN)
  - Role-specific details (academic, professional, family info)
  - Password management options

### 3. Enhanced Backend API
- **New controller** (`backend/controllers/userManagementController.js`)
- **Dedicated routes** (`backend/routes/userManagement.js`)
- **Proper data validation** and error handling
- **School-specific database operations**
- **Password reset functionality** for admin/teacher (not students)

### 4. Improved Data Retrieval and Display
- **Normalized data structure** from various database collections
- **Consistent user information display**
- **Role-specific badges and information**
- **Proper status indicators** (active/inactive, password change required)

### 5. Edit Functionality with Pre-filled Forms
- **Complete data loading** from backend
- **Form population** with existing user data
- **Field-level updates** without losing other information
- **Role-specific field handling**

### 6. Password Management
- **Automatic password generation** for students (based on DOB)
- **Secure random passwords** for admin/teacher
- **Password reset capability** (admin/teacher only)
- **Custom password option** during user creation
- **Password change requirement tracking**

### 7. Import/Export System
- **Comprehensive CSV templates** with all fields
- **Sample data** for each user type
- **Field mapping** for proper data import
- **Export with all user details**
- **Template download** for easy bulk import

### 8. Enhanced User Interface
- **Modern, responsive design**
- **Statistics dashboard** showing user counts by role
- **Advanced filtering** by role, class, and search terms
- **Bulk operations** (export, template download)
- **Action buttons** for each user (edit, delete, password reset)

```

## API Endpoints

All user management operations use the new standardized endpoints:

- `GET /api/user-management/:schoolCode/users` - Get all users
- `GET /api/user-management/:schoolCode/users/:userId` - Get user by ID
- `POST /api/user-management/:schoolCode/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/user-management/:schoolCode/users/:userId` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/user-management/:schoolCode/users/:userId` - Delete user
- `POST /api/user-management/:schoolCode/users/:userId/reset-password` - Reset password

## User Data Structure

### Common Fields (All Roles)
- Name (first, middle, last, display name)
- Email and contact information
- Address (permanent and current)
- Identity documents
- Emergency contact details

- **Proper data transformation** between display and storage formats

### 2. User Experience
- **Intuitive forms** with proper field grouping
- **Real-time validation** with helpful error messages
- **Role-based form sections** that show relevant fields only
- **Address copying** option (current same as permanent)

### 3. Administrative Features

- **Password management** for different user types
- **User status tracking** and management

### 4. Security
- **Role-based access control** (admin access required)

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **Adding Users**:
   - Click "Add User" button
   - Select user role (Student/Teacher/Admin)
   - Fill in the comprehensive form with all relevant details
   - Choose password generation method
   - Submit to create user

2. **Editing Users**:
   - Click edit button for any user
   - Form will be pre-filled with existing data
   - Make necessary changes
   - Submit to update user information

3. **Password Management**:
   - Use "Reset Password" for admin/teacher accounts
   - New password will be generated and displayed
   - Students use date-of-birth based passwords

4. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Use "Export" to download all user data
   - Use "Template" to download import template with sample data
   - Use "Import" to bulk upload users (template format required)

### Data Import Format

The system supports CSV import with the following structure:
- **Complete field coverage** for all user types
