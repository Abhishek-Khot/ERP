# Hierarchical Student View Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
The ManageUsers component now includes a hierarchical dropdown view for students organized by class (LKG, UKG, 1-12) and sections (A-M).

## ✨ New Features Added

### 1. View Mode Toggle
- **Table View**: Traditional table layout for all users
- **Class View**: Hierarchical dropdown structure (students only)

### 2. Enhanced Class Dropdown
Updated from "All Grades" to include:
- LKG, UKG
- Classes 1-12

### 3. Hierarchical Student Organization
```typescript
organizeStudentsByClass() {
  // Groups students by:
  // 1. Class (LKG, UKG, 1-12) - sorted in proper order
  // 2. Section (A-M) - alphabetically sorted
  // 3. Students - alphabetically sorted by name
}
```

### 4. Interactive Dropdown Structure

#### Class Level (Primary Level)
- **Click to expand/collapse** each class
- **Student count badge** showing total students in class
- **Proper ordering**: LKG → UKG → 1 → 2 → ... → 12

#### Section Level (Secondary Level)
- **Section headers** with student count per section
- **Expandable sections** under each class
- **Student count badges** for each section

#### Student Level (Tertiary Level)
- **Individual student cards** with:
  - Profile avatar with initials
  - Name and email
  - Student ID (if available)
  - Active/Inactive status
  - Action buttons (Edit, Reset Password, Delete)

## 🎨 User Interface

### View Mode Toggle
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center space-x-2 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-1">
  <button className={viewMode === 'table' ? 'active' : ''}>
    Table View
  </button>
  <button className={viewMode === 'hierarchy' ? 'active' : ''}>
    Class View
  </button>
</div>
```

### Hierarchical Display Structure
```
📚 Class LKG (25 students) ▶️
  📝 Section A (12 students)
    👤 Student 1 [Active] [Edit] [Reset] [Delete]
    👤 Student 2 [Active] [Edit] [Reset] [Delete]
  📝 Section B (13 students)
    👤 Student 3 [Inactive] [Edit] [Reset] [Delete]

📚 Class UKG (30 students) ▶️
  📝 Section A (15 students)
  📝 Section B (15 students)

📚 Class 1 (35 students) ▶️
📚 Class 2 (40 students) ▶️
...
📚 Class 12 (25 students) ▶️
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// New state variables added:
const [expandedClasses, setExpandedClasses] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'table' | 'hierarchy'>('table');
```

### Key Functions

#### `organizeStudentsByClass()`
- Groups filtered students by class and section
- Maintains proper class ordering (LKG, UKG, 1-12)
- Sorts sections alphabetically
- Sorts students by name within each section

#### `toggleClassExpansion(className)`
- Toggles expansion state for individual classes
- Uses Set data structure for efficient state management

### Data Structure
```typescript
{
  "LKG": {
    "A": [Student1, Student2, ...],
    "B": [Student3, Student4, ...]
  },
  "UKG": {
    "A": [Student5, Student6, ...],
    "B": [Student7, Student8, ...]
  },
  "1": {
    "A": [Student9, Student10, ...],
    "B": [Student11, Student12, ...]
  },
  // ... continues for all classes
}
```

## 📊 Class Ordering Logic

The system ensures proper educational progression ordering:

```typescript
const classOrder = ['LKG', 'UKG', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12'];
```

This provides:
- **Logical Flow**: From kindergarten through high school
- **Educational Standards**: Follows Indian school system
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Natural progression for administrators

- **Section Headers**: Light gray with green count badges
- **Student Cards**: White with hover effects
- **Status Indicators**: Green (Active) / Red (Inactive)

### Interactive Elements

- **Action Buttons**: Color-coded for different actions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
